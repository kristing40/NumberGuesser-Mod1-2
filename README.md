#####Number Guesser
This project utilizes basic html and css to give the page structure and it's unique look.

In phase two of the number guesser the application allows the user to pick a number that number is compared to a random number generated by the application, if the user enters a number that is either higher, lower, not a number(NaN) or the same number as the one randomly generated, they will receive and appropriate message.

In phase three, two new inputs are added for the user to pick a new range of numbers from which to guess (min and max values). If the user picks the same number this is randomly generated, the max value increases by 10 and the minimum value decreases by 10, giving the user a much wider range from which to guess, it also makes picking the same randomly generated number a bit harder each time the user wins.
